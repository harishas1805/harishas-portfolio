# 🎥 Portfolio Demo Video Script & Guide

Since you want to add a demo video of this portfolio to your resume, here is a professional script and guide on how to record it effectively.

## **1. Preparation**
- **Tool:** Use a screen recorder like **OBS Studio** (free), **Loom** (browser extension), or **Windows Key + Alt + R**.
- **Resolution:** Record in **1080p (1920x1080)** for best quality.
- **Browser:** Use a clean browser window (hide bookmarks bar, extensions). Use **Full Screen (F11)** for a cinematic look.
- **Theme:** Start in **Dark Mode** (since it's the default and looks premium).

## **3. Voiceover Script (Natural Student Tone)**

*Read this with a calm, enthusiastic pace. It should take about 60 seconds.*

**(0:30 - Internships & Grid)**
